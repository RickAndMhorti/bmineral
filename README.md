# bmineral
A Discord bot called Bmineral that does stuff (they're not rocks Marie, they're minerals)

In order to use this bot, you **MUST** have npm and install discord.js in the main directory via the terminal/command prompt. 
Relevant links: 
- https://www.npmjs.com/
- https://discord.js.org/#/ (Simply type 'npm install discord.js')

**You must install the relevant Discord npm packages.** They are ytdl-core (plays the music) and yt-search (find the music from your prompt). 
Type in the terminal:
'npm i ytdl-core'
'npm i yt-search'

**You must also install ffmpeg**. This will allow the bot to stream music from YouTube into Discord. Type in:
'npm install ffmpeg'
'npm install ffmpeg-static'
'npm install ffplay'
'npm install ffprobe'

KNOWN BUGS:
- **Music cuts out after 30 seconds: ** type 'npm update' in the console. Usually you have to update the ytdl-core, the terminal will notify you and provide the corresponding command. 

**DISCLAIMER**: Some of the stuff here is VERY memey and based on a bunch of inside jokes from Breaking Bad.
